		CommonName: "Desert Stink Beetle",
		Class: "Insecta",
		Order: "Coleoptera",
		Family: "Apidae",
		Genus: "Eleodes",
		Species: "",
		Description: "The desert stink beetle pictured here is standing on its head because it senses danger (probably me -- that's my middle name). It produces a foul odor to ward off predators and it produces it from its butt. Hence, the odd posture. Fun fact: The grasshopper mouse -- the world's only carnivorous mouse -- has figured out how to eat stink beetles safely. It grabs the beetle, rams it tail first into the soil and proceeds to eat it starting with the head. It doesn't eat the tail end, where the stink glands are located. Another fun fact: Male grasshopper mice are territorial and will throw back their heads and howl like tiny wolves. (I would love to see that!)",

		CommonName: "Diabolical Ironclad Beetle",
		Class: "Insecta",
		Order: "Coleoptera",
		Family: "Zopheridae",
		Genus: "Phloeodes",
		Species: "diabolicus",
		Description: "Found this beetle munching away on a huge mushroom. The ironclad part of the name refers to the fact that they have one of the hardest exoskeletons of all arthropods. In some species, it's so hard that collectors will sometimes use a small drill to make a hole for the pin!",

		Species: "",
		Description: "Hilltopping is an activity that many types of insects participate in. Male ants and young queens have wings. They will all fly to the absolute highest point in an area and congregate there in a huge swarm to mate. After mating, the males die and the queens fly off to try and start a new colony.",
