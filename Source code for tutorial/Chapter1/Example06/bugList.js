		Order: "Coleoptera",
		Family: "Meloidae",
		Genus: "Lytta",
		Species: "magister",
		Description: "A blister beetle feeding on the flowers of a fiddleneck plant. Blister beetles are so named because they secrete a blistering agent called cantharidin, which can cause severe chemical burns. Not a bad defense!",

		CommonName: "Velvet Ant",
		Class: "Insecta",
		Order: "Hymenoptera",
		Family: "Mutillidae",
		Genus: "",
		Species: "",
		Description: "The velvet ant is not an ant. It's a wasp. The females, such as the one pictured here, are wingless. The bright red and black coloration is called aposematic coloration. It's designed to make the wasp as noticeable as possible. Why, you ask? The velvet ant has an extremely painful sting. Insects and other animals that are capable of making life very unpleasant for predators who try to eat them often evolve memorable coloration schemes. That way, predators quickly learn to leave them alone. In fact, red and black is one of the most commmon aposematic color schemes. (See the desert blister beetle, also on this page.)",
