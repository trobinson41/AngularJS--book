		Description: "The tarantula hawk is an example of a parasitoid wasp. It will sting a taratula to paralyse it, then drag the spider to a brood chamber, where it lays a single egg on the spider's abdomen. When the egg hatches, the wasp larva begins eating the spider -- slowly. It actually eats the non-vital organs first to keep it alive for as long as possible! ",

		Species: "",
		Description: "This is a very tiny wasp -- about a millimeter long. It's an example of a hyperparasitoid. A parasitoid is a parasite that kills it's host. Many parasitoid wasps will inject an egg into the body of a host, which is often a larval insect. After the egg hatches, the wasp larva begins feeding on the host. The conura wasp, however, is not just a parasitoid -- it's a hyperparasitoid. It injects its egg into the larva of another type of parasitoid wasp!",
