		CommonName: "Giant Water Bug",
		Class: "Insecta",
		Order: "Hemiptera",
		Family: "Belostomatidae",
		Genus: "Abedus",
		Species: "indentatus",
		Description: "The female giant water bug uses bodily secretions to glue her eggs onto the back of her mate. (I haven't gotten a photo of that yet, unfortunately.) This particular bug was about the size of a quarter.",

		CommonName: "Wind Scorpion",
		Class: "Arachnida",
		Order: "Solifugae",
		Family: "",
		Genus: "",
		Species: "",
		Description: "The wind scorpion or sun spider is neither a scorpion nor a spider; although, they're more closely related to scorpions. Probably the most interesting thing about them, other than their generally weird appearance, is that their jaws (technical term: chelicerae) open vertically, unlike the mouth parts of most insects, which open horizontally.",

		CommonName: "Ant",
		Class: "Insecta",
		Order: "Hymenoptera",
		Family: "Formicidae",
		Genus: "",
		Species: "",
		Description: "\"Planetoid of the Ants!\" (Actually, it's an egg yolk.) I was a bit surprised that all ants are in the same family -- Formicidae. There are so many different kinds that I would have expected there to be multiple families.",

		CommonName: "Scorpion (under black light)",
		Class: "Arachnida",
		Order: "Scorpiones",
		Family: "",
		Genus: "",
		Species: "",
		Description: "Scorpions glow under ultraviolet light (black light). You can order a black light flashlight online and use it to search for scorpions at night. Actually, they're not hard to find without it, though. If you do a lot of night hiking in the American Southwest, you'll find plenty of them.",
