# BuggyAngularJS
This repository contains a book in MicroSoft Word format -- "Web Development with AngularJS and Visual Studio" -- and the source code and image files for the example programs.
This is a work in progress. More chapters and examples will be added periodically. I will also try to create a PDF version of the book when time permits.
